Feature: Test background of element
    As a developer
    I want to Test background of element

Scenario: check css attribute
        Given I open the url "http://beta.greenglobal.vn/"
        And   the css attribute "background-color" from element ".btn-work-with-us" is "#02a959"
        Then  I expect that the css attribute "background-color" from element ".btn-work-with-us" is "#02a959"
